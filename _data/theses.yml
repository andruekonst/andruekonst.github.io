    This work is devoted to development of new machine learning algorithms for regression and classification tasks based on decision trees.
    The research set the following goals:
      1. Research of decision tree-based machine learning approaches.
      2. Development of new machine learning algorithms.
      3. Analysis of developed algorithms.
      4. Comparison with other decision tree-based machine learning algorithms.
    The analysis of currently available decision tree-based algorithms has been made. Also, the applicability of Deep Forest to the regression task has been revised.
    The study resulted in two brand new machine learning algorithms: deep gradient boosting and adaptive gradient boosting ensemble; and the modification of decision tree-based gradient boosting.
    The numerical experiments made during the research, and comparison with other decision tree-based algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost, show that developed methods can be used to construct more precise models.
